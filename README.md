_I'm using also [Alfred Emoji](https://github.com/jukben/alfred-emoji) - don't hesitate to check it out as well_

This is basically a custom-tailored solution as most easier and quickest possible solution for search & past your favorite meme from your collection.

Honestly, I've built it just for my meeds, but I'm a good guy, so it's shared with the world and you can use it as well. ðŸ˜‚

P.S: It has been written in PHP, but please, my dear recruiters, I don't want any job involving coding in PHP.

You can download it in [Releases](https://github.com/jukben/alfred-meme/releases).
